    For this challenge you need to create a simple SELECT statement that will return all columns 
    from the people table, and join to the sales table so that you can return the COUNT 
    of all sales and RANK each person by their sale_count.

    people table schema

        id
        name

    sales table schema

        id
        people_id
        sale
        price

    You should return all people fields as well as the sale count as "sale_count" 
    and the rank as "sale_rank".

SELECT 
    p.id, p.name, 
    COUNT(s.sale) AS sale_count,
    SUM(s.price) AS sale_rank
FROM 
    people p 
        INNER JOIN sales s 
            ON s.people_id = p.id
GROUP BY 
    p.id, p.name
ORDER BY sale_rank;
